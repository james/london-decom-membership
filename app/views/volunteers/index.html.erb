<h2><%= @volunteer_role.name %> Volunteers</h2>

<p>Welcome to your volunteers! These people have requested to volunteer for your role.</p>

<p>Please contact them as soon as possible, and then mark them as 'contacted' so that we know that you have. We may pester you otherwise!</p>

<p>If you have confirmed that they will be volunteering with you, then mark them as confirmed. Otherwise you can remove them from this list.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact your volunteers however you want. Email, whatsapp, facebook, post. You can <%= link_to 'download a CSV', event_volunteer_role_volunteers_path(@event, @volunteer_role, format: :csv) %> of this list if that's helpful.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, reach out to the Volunteers Team via <a href="mailto:volunteers@londondecom.org">volunteers@londondecom.org</a>.</p>
